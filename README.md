## Ubuntu + Chrome Remote Desktop + Chrome docker image

This image is based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and contains [XFCE Desktop Environment](https://www.xfce.org/), [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) and Chrome + Firefox browsers.

It enables you to connect to the container via Chrome Remote Desktop and have desktop environment with web browsing inside the container even if you can't connect to your container directly (for example, your container us running behind [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)).

### Env variables
* `HOSTNAME` (optional, default: `myvirtualdesktop`). The name your host will be shown under in "Remote devices" list on Chrome Remote Desktop website.
* `CODE` (required). Authorization code generated by Chrome Remote Desktop.
* `PIN` (optional, default: `123456`). PIN code that you can come up with. It will be requested when you try to connect to a container via Chrome Remote Desktop.

### Why would I want it?

The image was created for Synology NAS users. It's a common case when NAS is running behind ISP NAT and users can't directly access it outside their local network, but they still are able to access NAS via Synology Quick Connect and start Docker container. 

Chrome Remote Desktop also uses outgoing connection to Google servers, enabling users to connect to the container and browse local network or Internet from their home IP address.

The more proper option (but more tricky in setting up) is using VPN on your NAS + [ZeroTier](https://docs.zerotier.com/devices/synology/) container to get around the problem of ISP NAT.
